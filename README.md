# Introduction

Mdbg is a toy command line debugger based upon ptrace.
It features basic code / syscall breakpoints, as well as program-local
symbol resolution.

Because of the very little time I could spend on this project, its data
structures aren't as efficient as I would like to: no caching is implemented
whatsoever (I had a hard time keeping myself from implementing any), list
are used where hashmaps would be appropriate, â€¦

I tried to focus on making simple and documented code achieving the purpose
of the requested exercise: making a debugger.


# Usage

Start it as with strace: `mdbg [program] [arguments...]`

All commands taking an address as a parameter can also take `%regname`.


# Requirements

 - `meson`
 - `GCC`
 - `libunwind`
 - `capstone`


# Building

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
meson ..
ninja
```

# Documentation

It can be generated by issuing

```sh
doxygen doc/doxyconfig`
```


# Installing

```sh
cd build
ninja install
```


# Todo

 - [TRIVIAL] implement attach
 - [TRIVIAL] clean and colorful logging
 - [TRIVIAL] safer elf parsing
 - [TRIVIAL] aliases
 - [EASY] resolve symbols located in libraries, by either finding _r_debug
 in ld.so or in DT_DEBUG.
 - [EASY] skip function preludes
 - [EASY] integrate with dish, my 42sh implem (its already modular
      so it should be ok)
 - [TIME] interpret dwarf metadata
 - [TIME] unit tests
